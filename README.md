#  Who Owes Me

**Who Owes Me** is a simple, honest web app built to solve a very real problem —  
remembering who borrowed money, without awkward conversations.

It’s made for moments like:
- “Did I pay last time?”
- “Was it ₹200 or ₹400?”
- “I’ll ask later…” (and never do)

This app quietly keeps track for you.

##  The Idea Behind It

Money between friends often feels uncomfortable.  
People don’t forget because they don’t care — they forget because asking feels weird.

**Who Owes Me** gives you a private space to:
- remember clearly  
- calculate automatically  
- avoid awkwardness  

No accounts. No reminders. No judgement.
